# Rosetta Code Examples

Each example is in its own directory which has the rosettacode.org path so
rosettacode.org/wiki/Averages/Arithmetic_mean corresponds to the
sub-directory `Averages/Arithmetic_mean`

    import("./Averages/Arithmetic_mean/example");
    import("./Binary_search/binary-search");
    import("./FizzBuzz/logs");
